# How to Play OSO

## Game Objective
In OSO, the goal is to form the `O-S-O` sequence in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) on a board. The player who gets the most sequences when the board is full wins.

## Basic Rules
1. Players take turns placing the letters `O` and `S` on the board.
2. The `O-S-O` sequence can be formed in any direction.
3. When a player forms the `O-S-O` sequence, they earn a point and the word `O-S-O` is crossed out on the board.
4. The game ends when the board is full.
5. The player with the most `O-S-O` sequences at the end of the game wins.
